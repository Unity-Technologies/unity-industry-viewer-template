# Asset preparation and management on Unity Cloud

You must prepare your assets before you can use them for data streaming.

**Note**: To use 3D Data Streaming in your project, you must be either a Unity Industry or Cloud customer. For more information, refer to [Prerequisites - Unity Cloud](prerequisites.md) and [Unity Industry](https://unity.com/products/unity-industry). 

## Individual Assets

To ready individual assets for data streaming:

1) Navigate to the [Unity Cloud landing page](https://cloud.unity.com) and sign in.  
2) Select the **Products** menu option.   
3) Under the **Tools** section, select **Asset Manager**.  
4) Select a 3D Model asset that you want to prepare for data streaming. If you need to upload a new 3D asset, refer to [Add a single asset](https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us/asset-manager/single-asset).  
5) In the side panel, select the **expand** icon.  
6) Select **Edit**.  
7) Open the **More** (**…**) menu on the **Source** dataset you want to ready for streaming.  
8) Select **Prepare for 3D Data Streaming**.

Once the transformation is complete, repeat this process for any other assets you want to use with the Industry Viewer Template.
