# Feature management

The Industry Viewer Template includes a **Features** folder that contains all the scripts and controllers required to manage the features of the template. The folder is divided into a series of subfolders that relates to a specific Unity package feature, such as **Assets**, **Identity**, **Localization**, and **Multiplay**.

Each feature folder contains the following key components:

* Assembly Definition Asset (.asmdef) file that defines the assembly name and references for the feature. For more information, refer to [Organizing scripts into assemblies](https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/assembly-definition-files.html).  
* A UI folder containing the relevant UI elements.  
* A Scripts folder containing the C# scripts that power the feature.  
* A Localization folder containing the localized strings for the feature.
